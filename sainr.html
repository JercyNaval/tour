        <p>Saint Joseph Patriarch located in Poblacion along Romulo Highway. This fine old Spanish-era church was first built in 1809 by Dominican Father Bernardo Ponce.  The foundation of the present church and bell tower were first laid by Fr. Benito Sanchez Fraga, continued by Frs. Ramon Dalmau and Francisco Treserra and finished by Fr. Pedro Villanova.  It was inaugurated on June 4, 1854.  The choir loft and sacristy were built by Fr. Lucio Asensio.  From 1866 to 1878, Fr. Gallego built the main altar and ceiling, painted the church and finished the bell tower.   The bell tower was destroyed during the March 16, 1892 earthquake and later repaired by Fr. Victor Herrero.</p>
